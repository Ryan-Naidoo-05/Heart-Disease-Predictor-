A Data Science project and machine learning model that predicts CAD disease risk with 90% AUC accuracy, based on the most important predictors

## Model Features
- **92% AUC score** - This score performs better than ECG standard (60-70% prediction rate)
- **Interactive Mini Web Application** - User-friendly Streamlit interface
- **Comprehensive Project Structure and Analysis** - Full data science workflow documented, from data cleaning to model discussion.

## Using the model:

### Prerequisites
- Python [e.g., 3.8 or higher]
- pip package manager

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ryan-Naidoo-05/Heart-Disease-Predictor-.git
cd Heart-Disease-Predictor-

# Installing the dependencies
